This is a FT2232H based JTAG programmer shield that is compatible with OpenOCD and Broadcom's WICED IDE. The FT2232 chip is setup to provide an USB-JTAG and USB-UART interface simultaneously. The FT2232 can be also reconfigured by the user by reprogramming the on-board config EEPROM. The unused pins are clearly marked and broken out into easy to access header holes.
